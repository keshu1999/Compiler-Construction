# **ERPLAG Compiler**
This was the semester long project for the course Compiler Construction (CS F363) in BITS Pilani. The Compiler designed was for a toy language called ERPLAG, made for the course. The Language Specifications and Syntax of the language is present in the Language Details folder.

# Modules
## Lexical Analysis (lexer.c)
- This module reads the source code in the toy language as a charater stream and converts them into set of tokens.
- The list of keywords used by the toy language are in the file Keywords.txt
- These tokens contain vital information such as about the line number, name of the token, token id and an optional value, which will be used by the parser later on.

## Syntactic Analysis (parser.c)
- Parser takes input as the sequence of tokens from the lexer and constructs the parse tree.
- Parse tree is constructed to verify the syntactic correctness of the input source code. The Grammar used is present in Grammar.txt file.
- In the case of Syntactic/Lexical errors, the parser goes through a error recovery scheme to continue parsing other statements leaving the error statement.

## Abstract Syntax Tree (ast.c)
- Parse Tree thus generated contains many unnecessary tokens. AST deletes all those and generates a compressed, optimized tree.
- Infix structure is used on the nodes of the tree and this AST is used in the later stages.

## Symbol Table Generation (symbolTable.c)
- This module constructs the Symbol Table using the AST generated.
- The symbol table has a tree structure of hash tables that which show scoping of the different blocks of code.
- Each node of the tree has a linked list of its locally defined variables. Each locally nested scope is shown as the child of it's parent scope.
- Errors reported here are related to redundant declaration, usage without declaration of variables and modules.

## Type Checkinng and Semantic Analysis (symbolTable.c)
- The same module also performs semantic analysis on the AST for verifiying semantic correctness of the source code.
- The Semantic Analysis uses the symbol table to check the correctness of expressions wrt their types. 
- Additional errors such as index out of bounds, function return semantics, invalid operations etc are reported here.


## Code Generation (assembler.c)
- Generates the NASM-assembly code of the source code if the input source code is syntactically and semantically correct.

## Testcases
- All the testcases are present inside [TestCases](TestCases) folder.
- The test cases are further divided innto different folders each of which check the different translational phases of the compiler.
- Along with that, Sample Codes contain some sample programs written in the toy language.

# Compatibility
- Unix (Linux / Mac)
- gcc 5.4.0+
- NASM version 2.12.01+

# Execution Instructions
## For Setup and Generating Assembly File
- Download this repository and change the directory to the [Code](Code) folder.
- Run `make`
- `compiler` executable is created.
You can use make clean to delete the old executable.
- After this, put the input source code in the Code directory and execute `./compiler {testcase.txt} {assemblyfile.asm}`
- If you don't provide the name of the assembley file, it is by default saved as `code.asm`

## For Executing the Assembly File
- If the file is saved as `code.asm`, you can alternatively run it by executing `make run`.
- Or else you can execute the following instructions.
    - `nasm -f elf64 -o code.o {Assembly_file_name}.asm`
    - `gcc -no-pie code.o -o code`
    - `./code`
- To remove all .o files and the compiler executable, execute `make clean`
